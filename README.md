## Hi, I'm Yannick Sala ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently undergoing web development training at AFPA, shifting my career towards web development. Passionate about digital arts and interactive creation, I consider myself a versatile creator. Beyond development, I explore various forms of expression like illustration, painting, game design, web design, and even music.
